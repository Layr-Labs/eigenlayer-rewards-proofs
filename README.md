# Introduction

Go library for generating EigenLayer rewards and claim proofs

# Usage Guidance

Please note this is a supporting library for other tools such as the Rewards Claiming [Web App UI](https://docs.eigenlayer.xyz/eigenlayer/restaking-guides/restaking-user-guide/testnet/rewards-claiming/claim-rewards/via-ui) and [CLI](https://docs.eigenlayer.xyz/eigenlayer/restaking-guides/restaking-user-guide/testnet/rewards-claiming/claim-rewards/via-cli). If you're trying to claim Rewards please use of these tools. Otherwise, this repo is intended for building custom tooling on top of the Rewards library.
